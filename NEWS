# bcbioBase 0.2.17 (2018-07-09)

## Major changes

- Heatmap functions (`plotHeatmap()`, `plotCorrelationHeatmap()`, and
  `plotQuantileHeatmap()`) now only provide method support for
  `SummarizedExperiment` class objects, for better simplicity and metadata
  handling. The internal method code has been consolidated and simplified,
  working internally on the main assay inside the S4 object.
- Migrated `convertGenesToSymbols()`, `gene2symbol()`, and `selectSamples()`
  S4 methods for `SummarizedExperiment` to the [basejump][] package.

## Minor changes

- Now requiring [ggplot2][] v3.0 internally.
- Switched to using `aes()` instead of `aes_string()` internally, using
  tidyeval.
- Updated viridis functions in reexports.



# bcbioBase 0.2.16 (2018-06-28)

## Minor changes

- Improved aggregate column handling in `bcbio_geom_abline()`.
- Improved code coverage back to 100%.
- Reorganized R methods files to use `-methods.R` as a suffix, as recommended
  by [Bioconductor][], in preparation for package submission.



# bcbioBase 0.2.15 (2018-06-05)

## New functions

- `minimalSampleData()` enables easy creation of a sample metadata `data.frame`
  by simplify specifying the sample names (e.g. "description" in [bcbio][]
  YAML). This function was added for easy metadata handling for 10X Cell Ranger
  in the [bcbioSingleCell][] package, but is generally applicable to other
  [bcbio][] datasets and may be incorporated into [bcbioRNASeq][] in a future
  update.

## Minor changes

- Improved internal `interestingGroups` handling inside `plotHeatmap()` family
  of functions.
- Removed message about transgeneNames and spikeNames in 
  `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` if missing transcripts are present. Now the
  function simply lists the genes that don't have metadata in `rowRanges()`.
- Reorganized assert checks imports in `bcbioBase-package.R` file.



# bcbioBase 0.2.14 (2018-05-18)

## Minor changes

- Improved formatting of package NEWS
- Improved code coverage by adding ggplot2 unit testing.
- Added `sampleData<-` method support for standard `data.frame`.



# bcbioBase 0.2.13 (2018-05-07)

## Minor changes

- Added `overwrite` parameter to `prepareTemplate()`, disabled by default.
- Removed validity check for `sampleData()` accessor.
- Improved vector return in `sampleNames()`.



# bcbioBase 0.2.12 (2018-05-08)

## Minor changes

- Migrated `sanitizeSampleData()` from basejump to bcbioBase.
- Don't return `interestingGroups` column in `sampleData()` return when
  `clean = TRUE`.
- Removed internal R Markdown shared files. These are already saved per bcbio R
  package.



# bcbioBase 0.2.11 (2018-05-07)

## New methods

- Added `SummarizedExperiment` method support for `sampleNames()` generic.



# bcbioBase 0.2.10 (2018-05-03)

## New functions

- Exporting [ggplot2][] convenience functions for easier plotting in
  [bcbioRNASeq][] and [bcbioSingleCell][] packages: `bcbio_geom_abline()`,
  `bcbio_geom_label()`, `bcbio_geom_label_average()`, and
  `bcbio_geom_label_repel()`.



# bcbioBase 0.2.9 (2018-04-30)

## Minor changes

- Improved assert check messages for interesting groups.
- Switched back to internally using `make.unique()` instead of `make.names()`
  for `convertGenesToSymbols()` coercion on SummarizedExperiment objects. We're
  using `make.names()` only when coercing seurat objects (see
  [bcbioSingleCell][] code).
- Updated `RangedSummarizedExperiment` working example, based on `bcbioRNASeq`
  example dataset.



# bcbioBase 0.2.8 (2018-04-25)

## Minor changes

- Split out assertive imports so we can pin release to [bioconda][].



# bcbioBase 0.2.7 (2018-04-25)

## Minor changes

- Updated recommended Bioconductor installation method for 3.7 release.
- Attempt to add `description` to `metadataBlacklist`.
- `readSampleData()`: Use `description` metadata column internally instead of
  `sampleID`.



# bcbioBase 0.2.6 (2018-04-25)

## Minor changes

- Using `make.names()` instead of `make.unique()` in `convertGenesToSymbols()`
  method for `SummarizedExperiment` class.



# bcbioBase 0.2.5 (2018-04-24)

## Major changes

- `sampleData()` now supports `clean = TRUE` argument, which will hide columns
  that contain metrics or other calculations from the user. This is useful when
  preparing an R Markdown report, where we only want to show relevant metadata
  (e.g. factor columns). This is enabled by default.
- Now using `metadataBlacklist` to hide specific columns in sample metadata.
- `sampleMetadata()` is now deprecated in favor of `sampleData()`. This function
  still works but will now warn the user, and should be removed from R Markdown
  template code.
- Added `SummarizedExperiment` to `list` coercion support, which uses the
  same code as `flatFiles()`.
- `readSampleData()` no longer requires or recommended `fileName` column. Only
  the `description` column is required for demultiplexed data. In the case of
  multiplexed samples (e.g. inDrops single-cell RNA-seq), then `sampleName`,
  `index` and `sequence` names are also required. Multiplexed cell ranger data
  only requires `sampleName` and `index`, since the index barcode isn't present
  in the counts matrix.

## Minor changes

- `sampleID` is no longer included in metadata priority columns. This is only
  to be used internally and should be hidden from the user where possible.
- `prepareSampleData()` is no longer needed and is now defunct.


# bcbioBase 0.2.4 (2018-04-22)

## Minor changes

- Reworked internal code for `readYAML()` family of functions.
- Reorganized and improved default arguments for heatmap functions.
- `readSampleData()`: switched to using `merge()` instead of `left_join()`
  internally.
- Reexporting viridis family of color functions, including `inferno()`, and
  the British variant `scale_colour_viridis()`.



# bcbioBase 0.2.3 (2018-04-19)

- `plotHeatmap()`, `plotQuantileHeatmap()`: Always attempt to convert genes to
  symbols for heatmaps.



# bcbioBase 0.2.2 (2018-04-16)

## Minor changes

- Improved unit tests for `convertGenesToSymbols()` and `gene2symbol()`.
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.



# bcbioBase 0.2.1 (2018-04-13)

## Major changes

- `convertGenesToSymbols()` now has method support for `SummarizedExperiment`.
- Updated example datasets to use `rse_bcb` and `rse_dds`.
- Simplified internal S4 method code for heatmap functions.
- `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` now supports transgenes with the
  `transgeneNames` argument (e.g. "EGFP"), and FASTA spike-ins with the
  `spikeNames` argument (e.g. "ERCCs"). Additionally, `rowRanges` and `colData`
  are no longer required and can be left `NULL`, although this isn't generally
  recommended.

## Minor changes

- Consolidated `sampleYAML()` function code.
- Consolidated assert check imports into `bcbioBase-package.R` file.
- Consolidated globals into `globals.R` file.
- Improved internal [pheatmap][] color support.



# bcbioBase 0.2.0 (2018-03-22)

## Major changes

- Added `sampleData()` generic. Providing method support for
  `SummarizedExperiment` class. This generic provides consistent sample
  metadata support in both the [bcbioRNASeq][] and [bcbioSingleCell][]
  packages. For [bcbioSingleCell][], `colData()` returns information about the
  cells, not the samples. For [bcbioRNASeq][], `colData()` and `sampleData()`
  provide similar information on the samples.
- Added `uniteInterestingGroups()` as a generic. Provides support for adding
  an `interestingGroups` column to a data frame.
- Added `SummarizedExperiment` method support for `gene2symbol()`,
  `interestingGroups()` generics.
- Converted `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` from a generic to a standard
  function.
- `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` now requires rowRanges and supports FASTA
  spike-ins with `isSpike` argument. This helps set up a `SingleCellExperiment`
  object in the [bcbioSingleCell][] package.
- `prepareTemplate()` has been converted from a generic to a standard
  function.
- `readDataVersions()` and `readProgramVersions()` now return an empty tibble
  if the file is missing. bcbio doesn't always output these files, so we have
  changed the behavior from stopping on a missing file to simply warning and
  returning empty.
- Added `sampleDirs()` function, that informs the user about the names of the
  sample directories in the bcbio run.

## Minor changes

- Improved internal factor sanitization of sample metadata for
  `readSampleMetadataFile()` and `sampleYAMLMetadata()`.
- Exporting `projectDirPattern` to match bcbio project directories (e.g.
  `2018-01-01_rnaseq`) across packages.
- Changed default of `rdsToken` in `copyToDropbox()` to be `NULL` instead of
  `NA`.
- Reduced the number of imports from basejump package.
- Now using `sessioninfo::session_info()` instead of
  `devtools::session_info()`.
- Added AppVeyor CI support for code testing on Windows.
- Made Travis CI checking stricter and added `BiocCheck()`.
- Simplified package dependencies in DESCRIPTION.

## Deprecations

- Deprecated `sampleMetadata()` in favor of `sampleData()`.
- Deprecated `flatFiles()` in favor of using `as(object, "list")` coercion
  method instead.
- Deprecated `prepareSampleMetadata()` in favor of `prepareSampleData()`.
- Made `annotable()` method on `SummarizedExperiment` objects defunct.



# bcbioBase 0.1.4 (2018-02-20)

- Don't include sample metadata in `summaryYAMLMetrics()` return.



# bcbioBase 0.1.3 (2018-02-19)

- Now exporting `assertFormalInterestingGroups()` in camel case.



# bcbioBase 0.1.2 (2018-02-18)

  bcbioRNASeq master branch.



# bcbioBase 0.1.1 (2018-02-17)

- Added internal assert checks.
- Now exporting `sampleMetadata<-()` assignment generic.
- Updated encrypted token for rdrop2 working example.
- Added `assert_formal_interesting_groups()` assert checks. Deprecated
  `checkInterestingGroups()`.



# bcbioBase 0.1.0 (2018-02-13)

- Preparing version pinning for [bioconda][]. Relaxed [rlang][] dependency
  from v0.1.6 to v0.1.2 and [tidyr][] dependency from v0.7.2 to v0.7.1.
- Added `copyToDropbox()` function, which enables input of a list of local
  files and returns [Dropbox][] paths using [rdrop2][].
- Updated [basejump][] dependency to v0.2.1.
- Added assertive checks for all functions.



# bcbioBase 0.0.3 (2018-01-27)

- NAMESPACE export fixes.
- Minor code cleanup to pass [lintr][] checks.
- Switched to [rlang][] methods for errors, messages, and warnings:
  `abort()`, `inform()`, and `warn()`.
- Messages now consistently use backticks instead of apostrophes, as
  recommended by the [tidyverse style guide][].
- Removed [tibble][] rownames support from `prepareSampleMetadata()`.
- Improved code coverage to 100%.
