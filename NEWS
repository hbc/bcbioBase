## bcbioBase 0.4.2 (2019-02-15)

### Minor changes

- Unit test and deprecated function updates to maintain compatibility with new
  [basejump][] v0.9 release series.


## bcbioBase 0.4.1 (2018-08-19)

### Minor changes

- `prepareTemplate()`: Migrated function to [basejump][] package, and simplifed
  to copy all files from `rmarkdown/shared` directory inside a package.
  Currently in use by [bcbioRNASeq][] and [bcbioSingleCell][].


## bcbioBase 0.4.0 (2018-08-08)

This is a maintenance release designed to simplify the package for long-term
stability. Here we are moving all of the current S4 method support to
[basejump][] for consistency, since the methods apply to `SummarizedExperiment`
and are not [bcbio][]-workflow specific. We are keeping the package simple by
exporting the `read*` family of functions here, which are designed to integrate
with the [bcbio][] output directories.

### Major changes

- Moved S4 method support to [basejump][]: `flatFiles`, `metrics`,
  `plotCorrelationHeatmap`, `plotDot`, `plotGene`, `plotHeatmap`,
  `plotQuantileHeatmap`, `plotViolin`.
- `prepareSummarizedExperiment` has been moved to [basejump][] and renamed
  to `makeSummarizedExperiment`, for consistency. The underlying code remains
  the same.
- Moved the `SummarizedExperiment` to `list` coercion method to [basejump][].
- Reduced the number of re-exported [ggplot2][] and [viridis][] functions, for
  simplicity.


## bcbioBase 0.3.2 (2018-07-31)

### Minor changes

- Offloaded `separatorBar` and `updateMsg` to [basejump][].
- Now using [roxygen2][] v6.1 for documentation.
- Miscellaneous documentation improvements.
- Simplified installation instructions, referring the user to [bcbioRNASeq][]
  and [bcbioSingleCell][] packages instead.
- [lintr][] check fixes.


## bcbioBase 0.3.1 (2018-07-24)

### Minor changes

- Added hexadecimal color support to heatmap functions.
- Improved documentation, specifying the supported types for each argument more
  clearly.
- Improved messages in `readYAML` family of functions.


## bcbioBase 0.3.0 (2018-07-17)

### Major changes

- Moved some generics that provide `SummarizedExperiment` method suport to
  [basejump][] package: `gene2symbol`, `interestingGroups`, `sampleData`,
  `sampleNames`, `sanitizeSampleData`, `selectSamples`,
  `uniteInterestingGroups`.
- Moved method support for `SummarizedExperiment` to [basejump][]:
  `convertGenesToSymbols`, `counts`, `gene2symbol`, `interestingGroups`,
  `sampleData`, etc.
- Heatmap functions now only provide `SummarizedExperiment` method support.
  The documentation for these heatmap functions has been improved (and
  simplified), showing the supported arguments more clearly.

### Minor changes

- Now using `transcriptID` instead of `txID` in tx2gene and GRanges metadata
  defined in `rowRanges` slot of object.
- Now using `aes` instead of `aes_string` for all internal [ggplot2][] code,
  which uses tidyeval (v3.0 update).
- Moved `rse_bcb` and `rse_bcb` example data to [basejump][], for unit testing.
  These datasets are still available in [bcbioBase][].
- Made `assertFormalAnnotationCol` function defunct. No longer using to check
  `annotationCol` argument integration in heatmap functions, since we're now
  providing only `SummarizedExperiment` method support, instead of matrix
  method support (which is too complicated and error prone for users).
- Moved `assertFormalInterestingGroups` function to [basejump][], where the
  other assert check functions are defined. This helps improve package
  consistency.
- Updated unit tests to reflect changes in the number of exported generics.


## bcbioBase 0.2.16 (2018-06-28)

### Minor changes

- Improved aggregate column handling in `bcbio_geom_abline`.
- Improved code coverage back to 100%.
- Reorganized R methods files to use `-methods.R` as a suffix, as recommended
  by [Bioconductor][], in preparation for package submission.



## bcbioBase 0.2.15 (2018-06-05)

### New functions

- `minimalSampleData` enables easy creation of a sample metadata `data.frame`
  by simplify specifying the sample names (e.g. "description" in [bcbio][]
  YAML). This function was added for easy metadata handling for 10X Cell Ranger
  in the [bcbioSingleCell][] package, but is generally applicable to other
  [bcbio][] datasets and may be incorporated into [bcbioRNASeq][] in a future
  update.

### Minor changes

- Improved internal `interestingGroups` handling inside `plotHeatmap` family
  of functions.
- Removed message about transgeneNames and spikeNames in
  `prepareSummarizedExperiment` if missing transcripts are present. Now the
  function simply lists the genes that don't have metadata in `rowRanges`.
- Reorganized assert checks imports in `bcbioBase-package.R` file.


## bcbioBase 0.2.14 (2018-05-18)

### Minor changes

- Improved formatting of package NEWS.
- Improved code coverage by adding ggplot2 unit testing.
- Added `sampleData<-` method support for standard `data.frame`.


## bcbioBase 0.2.13 (2018-05-07)

### Minor changes

- Added `overwrite` parameter to `prepareTemplate`, disabled by default.
- Removed validity check for `sampleData` accessor.
- Improved vector return in `sampleNames`.


## bcbioBase 0.2.12 (2018-05-08)

### Minor changes

- Migrated `sanitizeSampleData` from basejump to bcbioBase.
- Don't return `interestingGroups` column in `sampleData` return when
  `clean = TRUE`.
- Removed internal R Markdown shared files. These are already saved per bcbio R
  package.


## bcbioBase 0.2.11 (2018-05-07)

### New methods

- Added `SummarizedExperiment` method support for `sampleNames` generic.


## bcbioBase 0.2.10 (2018-05-03)

### New functions

- Exporting [ggplot2][] convenience functions for easier plotting in
  [bcbioRNASeq][] and [bcbioSingleCell][] packages: `bcbio_geom_abline`,
  `bcbio_geom_label`, `bcbio_geom_label_average`, and `bcbio_geom_label_repel`.


## bcbioBase 0.2.9 (2018-04-30)

### Minor changes

- Improved assert check messages for interesting groups.
- Switched back to internally using `make.unique` instead of `make.names`
  for `convertGenesToSymbols` coercion on SummarizedExperiment objects. We're
  using `make.names` only when coercing seurat objects
  (see [bcbioSingleCell][] code).
- Updated `RangedSummarizedExperiment` working example, based on `bcbioRNASeq`
  example dataset.


## bcbioBase 0.2.8 (2018-04-25)

### Minor changes

- Split out assertive imports so we can pin release to [bioconda][].


## bcbioBase 0.2.7 (2018-04-25)

### Minor changes

- Updated recommended Bioconductor installation method for 3.7 release.
- Attempt to add `description` to `metadataBlacklist`.
- `readSampleData`: Use `description` metadata column internally instead of
  `sampleID`.


## bcbioBase 0.2.6 (2018-04-25)

### Minor changes

- Using `make.names` instead of `make.unique` in `convertGenesToSymbols` method
  for `SummarizedExperiment` class.


## bcbioBase 0.2.5 (2018-04-24)

### Major changes

- `sampleData` now supports `clean = TRUE` argument, which will hide columns
  that contain metrics or other calculations from the user. This is useful when
  preparing an R Markdown report, where we only want to show relevant metadata
  (e.g. factor columns). This is enabled by default.
- Now using `metadataBlacklist` to hide specific columns in sample metadata.
- `sampleMetadata` is now deprecated in favor of `sampleData`. This function
  still works but will now warn the user, and should be removed from R Markdown
  template code.
- Added `SummarizedExperiment` to `list` coercion support, which uses the same
  code as `flatFiles`.
- `readSampleData` no longer requires or recommended `fileName` column. Only
  the `description` column is required for demultiplexed data. In the case of
  multiplexed samples (e.g. inDrops single-cell RNA-seq), then `sampleName`,
  `index` and `sequence` names are also required. Multiplexed cell ranger data
  only requires `sampleName` and `index`, since the index barcode isn't present
  in the counts matrix.

### Minor changes

- `sampleID` is no longer included in metadata priority columns. This is only
  to be used internally and should be hidden from the user where possible.
- `prepareSampleData` is no longer needed and is now defunct.


## bcbioBase 0.2.4 (2018-04-22)

### Minor changes

- Reworked internal code for `readYAML` family of functions.
- Reorganized and improved default arguments for heatmap functions.
- `readSampleData`: switched to using `merge` instead of `left_join` internally.
- Reexporting viridis family of color functions, including `inferno`, and
  the British variant `scale_colour_viridis`.


## bcbioBase 0.2.3 (2018-04-19)

- `plotHeatmap`, `plotQuantileHeatmap`: Always attempt to convert genes to
  symbols for heatmaps.



## bcbioBase 0.2.2 (2018-04-16)

### Minor changes

- Improved unit tests for `convertGenesToSymbols` and `gene2symbol`.
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.


## bcbioBase 0.2.1 (2018-04-13)

### Major changes

- `convertGenesToSymbols` now has method support for `SummarizedExperiment`.
- Updated example datasets to use `rse_bcb` and `rse_dds`.
- Simplified internal S4 method code for heatmap functions.
- `prepareSummarizedExperiment` now supports transgenes with the
  `transgeneNames` argument (e.g. "EGFP"), and FASTA spike-ins with the
  `spikeNames` argument (e.g. "ERCCs"). Additionally, `rowRanges` and `colData`
  are no longer required and can be left `NULL`, although this isn't generally
  recommended.

### Minor changes

- Consolidated `sampleYAML` function code.
- Consolidated assert check imports into `bcbioBase-package.R` file.
- Consolidated globals into `globals.R` file.
- Improved internal [pheatmap][] color support.



## bcbioBase 0.2.0 (2018-03-22)

### Major changes

- Added `sampleData` generic. Providing method support for
  `SummarizedExperiment` class. This generic provides consistent sample
  metadata support in both the [bcbioRNASeq][] and [bcbioSingleCell][]
  packages. For [bcbioSingleCell][], `colData` returns information about the
  cells, not the samples. For [bcbioRNASeq][], `colData` and `sampleData`
  provide similar information on the samples.
- Added `uniteInterestingGroups` as a generic. Provides support for adding an
  `interestingGroups` column to a data frame.
- Added `SummarizedExperiment` method support for `gene2symbol`,
  `interestingGroups` generics.
- Converted `prepareSummarizedExperiment` from a generic to a standard function.
- `prepareSummarizedExperiment` now requires rowRanges and supports FASTA
  spike-ins with `isSpike` argument. This helps set up a `SingleCellExperiment`
  object in the [bcbioSingleCell][] package.
- `prepareTemplate` has been converted from a generic to a standard function.
- `readDataVersions` and `readProgramVersions` now return an empty tibble
  if the file is missing. bcbio doesn't always output these files, so we have
  changed the behavior from stopping on a missing file to simply warning and
  returning empty.
- Added `sampleDirs` function, that informs the user about the names of the
  sample directories in the bcbio run.

### Minor changes

- Improved internal factor sanitization of sample metadata for
  `readSampleMetadataFile` and `sampleYAMLMetadata`.
- Exporting `projectDirPattern` to match bcbio project directories
  (e.g. `2018-01-01_rnaseq`) across packages.
- Changed default of `rdsToken` in `copyToDropbox` to be `NULL` instead of `NA`.
- Reduced the number of imports from basejump package.
- Now using `sessioninfo::session_info` instead of
  `devtools::session_info`.
- Added AppVeyor CI support for code testing on Windows.
- Made Travis CI checking stricter and added `BiocCheck`.
- Simplified package dependencies in DESCRIPTION.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated `sampleMetadata` in favor of `sampleData`.
- Deprecated `flatFiles` in favor of using `as(object, "list")` coercion method
  instead.
- Deprecated `prepareSampleMetadata` in favor of `prepareSampleData`.
- Made `annotable` method on `SummarizedExperiment` objects defunct.


## bcbioBase 0.1.4 (2018-02-20)

- Don't include sample metadata in `summaryYAMLMetrics` return.


## bcbioBase 0.1.3 (2018-02-19)

- Now exporting `assertFormalInterestingGroups` in camel case.


## bcbioBase 0.1.2 (2018-02-18)

- Added back `checkInterestingGroups` since this code is still present on
  [bcbioRNASeq][] master branch.


## bcbioBase 0.1.1 (2018-02-17)

- Added internal assert checks.
- Now exporting `sampleMetadata<-` assignment generic.
- Updated encrypted token for rdrop2 working example.
- Added `assert_formal_interesting_groups` assert checks. Deprecated
  `checkInterestingGroups`.


## bcbioBase 0.1.0 (2018-02-13)

- Preparing version pinning for [bioconda][]. Relaxed [rlang][] dependency from
  v0.1.6 to v0.1.2 and [tidyr][] dependency from v0.7.2 to v0.7.1.
- Added `copyToDropbox` function, which enables input of a list of local files
  and returns [Dropbox][] paths using [rdrop2][].
- Updated [basejump][] dependency to v0.2.1.
- Added assertive checks for all functions.


## bcbioBase 0.0.3 (2018-01-27)

- NAMESPACE export fixes.
- Minor code cleanup to pass [lintr][] checks.
- Switched to [rlang][] methods for errors, messages, and warnings: `abort`,
  `inform`, and `warn`.
- Messages now consistently use backticks instead of apostrophes, as recommended
  by the [tidyverse style guide][].
- Removed [tibble][] rownames support from `prepareSampleMetadata`.
- Improved code coverage to 100%.


## bcbioBase 0.0.2 (2018-01-19)

- Re-export `assignAndSaveData`, `loadData`, `loadRemoteData`, `saveData` from
  [basejump][] package.
